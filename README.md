# Coral Bleaching Project

Coral bleaching is a phenomenon that has been taking place across all coral reefs spread out over the world. Healthy coral contains a symbiotic algae; the coral provides a home for the algae and the algae provides food for the coral via photosynthesis. As things like climate change, tourism, and pollution alter this relationship the algae separates from the coral and this results in coral bleaching. Coral bleaching can be easily detected as the coral turns from its normal colors to a stark white color.

This repository/project serves as an intermediate stepping stone building off of the backs of other groups like this article by Madireddy et al titled ["Using machine learning to develop a global coral bleaching predictor"](https://emerginginvestigators.org/articles/22-056) [1] and providing some insights as to next steps that could be looked into in the world of coral bleaching.

In doing some preliminary research for this project, the contributors looked to expand on past findings by answering the following:
1. How does turbidity affect coral bleaching?
2. How does fertilizer runoff affect coral bleaching?
3. Can we predict coral bleaching events based on weather patterns/trends?
4. Can we identify which sites are most at risk to coral bleaching?
